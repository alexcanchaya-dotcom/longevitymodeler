- **Comparison Tools**: Compare results with population averages

### Input Factors

#### Demographics
- Age, Gender, Ethnicity
- Location and country of residence
- Socioeconomic factors

#### Lifestyle Factors
- Exercise frequency and intensity
- Diet quality and patterns
- Sleep duration and quality
- Stress levels
